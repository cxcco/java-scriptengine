## Backport to Java 8

The `java-scriptengine` was backported to Java 8.

This has some impact on the Java Module (Jigsaw) support.
- The `module-info.class` was removed
- The `Automatic-Module-Name: ch.obermuhlner.scriptengine.java` header in the `MANFEST.MF` was added again 

In Java 8 the special permission policy `codeBase` protocol `jrt:` is not supported.

Therefore special `codeBase` for the permission policy 
`jrt:/ch.obermuhlner.scriptengine.java/memory-class` was removed
and the `http://ch.obermuhlner/ch.obermuhlner.scriptengine.java/memory-class` was used instead.
